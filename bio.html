            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I'm Harry, a second-year CS student at the University of Oregon Clark Honors College. When I'm not coding, I'm watching basketball, playing video games, climbing, cooking, hurting myself 
                playing soccer, hurting myself playing basketball, or hurting myself at the gym.</p>

            <h1>Technical Interests</h1>
            <p>I'm fascinated by game development. The process of creating something not only technically sound, but with intriguing design, is a challenge I enjoy tackling. Creating narratives and art, while applying complex algorithms and managing large code bases, 
                invokes every ounce of my abilities. Beyond that, web development and machine learning are interests of mine, but not entirely explored. Working with software to apply it to things I'm passionate about (I.e. games, sports, and writing), while learning about
                and leveraging new technologies, is my ultimate goal.
